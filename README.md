## Introduction ##
A multi-agent system consists of multiple interacting intelli-gent agents within an environment. Among the agents, com-munication could occur as a way of sharing information. The amount and quality of information shared may influence the agentsâ€™ behaviors. A foraging model is implemented as a platform to figure out the influence of communication on the behaviors in the system and whether it earns its complexity.

## Specification ##

The final paper is in the folder called **Final Paper**.

The **Data** folder contains the data collected.

The **Demo** folder contains the demo videos.

The source code is called **FORAGING**. It is the newest version of our project, with good appearance and well organized scripts. To run the code, import it by Unity and run.

## Notice ##

In a nutshell, communication behavior makes agents looks real, but not faster.
